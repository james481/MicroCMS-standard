MicroCMS - Micro framework for small sites
==========================================

This framework is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, but allow for later transition to heavier frameworks (Symfony) if needed. It provides a basic kernel with logging and twig rendering, and a very simple default routing scheme.

It is currently in pre-alpha stage, and is very much incomplete.

This framework is implemented in the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) namespace standard.
